            This second lesson of the “ASP.Net Core for beginners” course is almost entirely hands on. We will satrt implementing our API, by first setting up our project structure according to a layered architecture. We will implement our first endpoints and we will then talk about dependency injection.

              We can go further and build a <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>composition root</span> where we can do this kind of type initializations. The composition root is a simple class which will get called when the application is first initialized. In that class, we can resolve the specific types for our abstractions.
            </p>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            As you can see here, we have configured our HTTPRequest in such a way that if someone requests the <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>TodoControllerwe</span> will instantiate a new instance of <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>TodoRepository</span> and pass it to the controller&#39;s constructor. Likewise, we can change it to<span style={{ color: 'red' }}>TodoCSVRepository or TodoInMemoryepository</span> whenever we feel like. Now we have a single place to do all our dirty works of type initializations. In Web API projects we have to register this composition root in the <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>Global.asax.cs</span> file like this, 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <span className="bold" style={{ padding: '.75em 1em' }}>Code: </span> 
          <CompositionRoot />
        </div>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;" style={{ padding: '.75em 1em' }}>
                One thing to remember here is, a composition root implementation varies from framework to framework. Here we are working with Web API so this won’t work for MVC (may work) and WPF applications. You have to find a way to implement those but don’t worry because the internet has a lot of code snippets that can ease up your task of creating a composition root for a specific framework. Tell you what, I learned how to make a composition root like this for Web API projects after reading a blog from <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>Mark Seeman</span>. Here is the link for it,
            </p>

            </p>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              That’s good since we have to deal with resolving tiny dependencies for this small project of ours. What if we have a large project where hundreds of dependencies are scattered around? In that cases, composition root won’t be a good idea. That is why in enterprise level, we use a well-known IoC (Inversion of Control) container to make our job easy. IoC containers can resolve dependencies recursively and they are also pretty much easy to configure. They allows us to work with dependency injection lifecycle easily.
              There are many IoC containers available and most of them do the same things somewhat differently. Let’s use one of them in our current project. Let’s pick Autofac which has a great documentation online. Here is the link where you can know all about the Autofac integration related stuff with Web API projects,

            <p>
            This library makes it easy to be a client for InfluxDB on .NET!The basic idea behind the library is that it should be able to turn queries directly into objects of your own classes. Much like micro-ORMS such as dapper.            
            </p>

            <p>
            The goal is that we want to be able to support LINQ syntax in the future.

            Start by defining a class that represents a row in InfluxDB that you want to store.
            </p>
            <p>
                  <MikaelGRAComputerInfoComponent2 />
                </p>
                <p>
                  On your POCO class you must specify these things:
              </p>
                <p>
                            <ol>
                              <p>
                                <li>
                                <span className="article-post-sub"> 1.  </span> 1 property with the type DateTime, DateTime?, DateTimeOffset or DateTimeOffset? as the timestamp used in InfluxDB by adding the [InfluxTimestamp] attribute.
                              </li>
                              </p>
                            <p>
                              <li>
                                <span className="article-post-sub">2.  </span>  0-* properties with the type string, long, ulong, int, uint, short, ushort, byte, sbyte, double, float, bool, DateTime, DateTimeOffset, decimal or a user-defined enum (nullables too) with the [InfluxTag] attribute that InfluxDB will use as indexed tags. Note that all tags in InfluxDB is still stored a string. The library will simply making the conversion to the specified type automatically.
                              </li>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <li>
                                <span className="article-post-sub">3.  </span>  1-* properties with the type string, long, ulong, int, uint, short, ushort, byte, sbyte, double, float, bool, DateTime, DateTimeOffset, decimal or a user-defined enum (nullables too) with the [InfluxField] attribute that InfluxDB will use as fields.
                              </li>
                            </p>

                            </ol>
                          </p>

              <p>
              Once you&#39;ve defined your class, you&#39;re ready to use the InfluxClient, which is the main entry point to the API:
              </p>

              Here&#39;s how to write to the database:

            </p>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              I wanted to grab the 10 latest transactions and 10 latest customers in one LINQ query
            </p>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              It is a bit unclear what you want. I doubt that you want one sequence with a mix of Customers and Transactions. I guess that you want the 10 newest Customers, each with their last 10 Transactions?
            </p>

            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              I wonder why you would deviate from the <a href="https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/code-first/code-first-conventions.aspx" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>entity framework code first</a> conventions. If your class Customer represents a row in your database, then surely it doesn&#39;t have a <span className="angle-braces">HashSet &lt;Transaction&gt;</span>?
            </p>

            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              A one-to-many of a Customer with his Transactions should be modeled as follows: 
            </p>




            <div>
              <span className="bold" style={{ padding: '.75em 1em' }}>Code: </span> 
              <HaraldCoppoolsePullDataInOneSqlQueryLinq1 />
            </div>
            
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            This is all that entity framework needs to know to detect the tables you want to create, to detect your one-to-many relationship, and to detect the primary keys and foreign keys. Only if you want different names of tables or columns, you&#39;ll need attributes and/or fluent API
The major differences between my classes and yours, is that the one-to-many relation is represented by <span className="angle-braces">virtual properties</span>. The HashSet is an ICollection. After all, your Transactions table is a collection of rows, not a HashSet
            </p>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            In entity framework the columns of your tables are represented by non-virtual properties; the virtual properties represent the relations between the tables (one-to-many, many-to-many, ...)
            </p>
            <p>
            Quite a lot of people tend to (group-)join tables, when they are using entity framework. However, life is much easier if you use the virtual properties
            </p>
            <p>
              Back to your question
            </p>
            <p>
            I want (some properties of) the 10 newest Customers, each with (several properties of) their 10 latest Transactions
            </p>
            <div>
              <span className="bold" style={{ padding: '.75em 1em' }}>Code: </span> 
              <HaraldCoppoolsePullDataInOneSqlQueryLinq2 />
            </div>
            <p>
              Entity framework knows the one-to-many relationship and recognizes that a group-join is needed for this.
            </p>
            <p>One of the slower parts of your query is the transfer of the selected data from the DBMS to your local process. Hence it is wise to limit the selected data to the data you actually plan to use. If Customer with Id 4 has 1000 Transactions, it would be a waste to transfer the foreign key for every Transaction, because you know it has value 4.

                          By default EF will look for the foreign key property with the same name as the principal entity primary key name.
                          If the foreign key property does not exist, then EF will create an FK column in the Db table with &lt;Dependent Navigation Property Name&gt; + &#34;_&#34; + &lt;Principal Entity Primary Key Property Name&gt;

            <p>
            When I read Stack Overflow questions involving time zones, there &#39;s almost always someone giving the advice to only ever store UTC. Convert to UTC as soon as you can, and convert back to a target time zone as late as you can, for display purposes, and you &#39;ll never have a time zone issue again, they say.
            </p>

            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              This blog post is intended to provide a counterpoint to that advice. I&#39;m certainly not saying storing UTC is always the wrong thing to do, but it s not always the right thing to do either.
              Note on simplifications: this blog post does not go into supporting non-Gregorian calendar systems, or leap seconds. Hopefully developers writing applications which need to support either of those are already aware of their requirements.

              Background: EU time zone rule changes
            </h4>
            <p>
            The timing of this blog post is due to recent European Parliament proceedings that look like they will probably end the clocks changing twice a year into “summer time” or “winter time” within EU member states. The precise details are yet to be finalized and are unimportant to the bigger point, but for the purpose of this blog post I&#39;ll assume that each member state has to decide whether they will “spring forward” one last time on March 28th 2021, then staying in permanent “summer time”, or “fall back” one last time on October 31st 2021, then staying in permanent “winter time”. So from November 1st 2021 onwards, the UTC offset of each country will be fixed – but there may be countries which currently always have the same offset as each other, and will have different offsets from some point in 2021. (For example, France could use winter time and Germany could use summer time.)
            </p>
            <p>
            The larger point is that time zone rules change, and that applications should expect that they will change. This isn&#39;t a corner case, it&#39;s the normal way things work. There are usually multiple sets of rule changes (as released by IANA) each year. At least in the European changes, we&#39;re likely to have a long notice period. That often isn&#39;t the case – sometimes we don&#39;t find out about rule changes until a few days before they happen.

            </h5>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            I&#39;ve been dealing a lot with timestamps, timezones and database recently - especially on PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.roji.org/postgresql-dotnet-timestamp-mapping" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>(see this blog post)</a>, but also in general. Recently, on the Entity Framework Core community standup, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLJLfImuFqM&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oX-DBuRG4u58ZTAJgBAeQ-t&index=3" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>we also hosted <span className="angle-braces">Jon Skeet </span></a> and chatted about NodaTime, timestamps, time zones, UTC and how they all relate to databases - I highly recommend watching that!
            </p>

            <p>
            Now, a lot has been said about “UTC everywhere”; according to this pattern, all date/time representations in your system should always be in UTC, and if you get a local timestamp externally (e.g. from a user), you convert it to UTC as early as possible. The idea is to quickly clear away all the icky timezone-related problems, and to have a UTC-only nirvana from that point on. While this works well for many cases - e.g. when you just want to record when something happened in the global timeline - it is not a silver bullet, and you should think carefully about it. Jon Skeet already explained this better than I could, so go read his  <a href="https://www.roji.org/storing-timezones-in-the-db" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>blog post on this</a>. As a very short tl;dr, time zone conversion rules may change after the moment you perform the conversion, so the user-provided local timestamp (and time zone) may start converting to a <em>different</em> UTC timestamp at some point! As a result, for events which take place on a specific time in a specific time zone, it&#39;s better to store the local timestamp and the time zone (not offset!).
            </p>

            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              So let&#39;s continue Jon&#39;s blog post, and see how to actually perform that on two real databases - PostgreSQL and SQL Server. Following Jon&#39;s preferred option, we want to store the following in the database:
            </p>
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li> <span className="bold">1. </span>The user-provided local timestamp.</li>
                <li><span className="bold">2. </span>The user-provided time zone ID. This is not an offset, but rather a daylight savings-aware time zone, represented as a string.</li>
                <li><span className="bold">3. </span>A UTC timestamp that&#39;s computed (or generated) from the above two values. This can be used to order the rows by their occurrence on the global timeline, and can even be indexed.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>

            <p>           
              In <span className="angle-braces">Jon&#39;s  <a href="https://nodatime.org/" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>NodaTime library</a>, the <a href="https://nodatime.org/3.0.x/api/NodaTime.ZonedDateTime.html" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>ZonedDateTime type</a></span> precisely represents the first two values above. Unfortunately, databases typically don&#39;t have such a type; SQL Server does have <span className="whiteBackground">datetimeoffset</span>, but an offset is not a time zone (it isn&#39;t daylight savings-aware). So we must use separate columns to represent the data above.
            </p>

              PostgreSQL
            </h4>

              <p>
              PostgreSQL conveniently has a type called timestamp without time zone for local timestamps in an unspecified time zone, and a badly-named type called timestamp with time zone, for UTC timestamps (no time zone is actually persisted); those are perfect for our two timestamps. We also want the UTC timestamp to be generated from the two other values, so we’ll set up a PostgreSQL generated column (called computed column by EF Core) to do that. Here&#39;s the minimal EF Core model and context, using <span className="angle-braces">the NodaTime plugin:</span>

            I recently came across an issue with several of our ASP.NET WebAPI services which were consuming a third-party set of APIs. These third-party APIs were configured to disable any requests from clients that were using  <span className="bold">TLS 1.0/1.1</span>. Unfortunately, this included our own APIs. All requests to the third-party API were returning empty responses. After some discussion with one of the developers of the third-party APIs, he suggested the issue may be related to <span className="bold">TLS 1.2</span> not being supported as he had seen the issue before.

                I was able to run the third-party APIs from our local test environment, but not when I ran them from our staging / production environments which were hosted on Azure. I had to make several changes, including code changes to the ASP.NET WebAPI services and changes to our Azure hosting environments.
              </p>
              <p>
                As many current servers are moving towards <span className="bold">TLS 1.2/1.3</span> and removing support for <span className="bold">TLS 1.0 /1.1</span>, connectivity issues between newer servers and older (legacy) .NET applications are becoming more common. Installing a newer version of the .NET Framework onto your development environment is not the answer. The solution is down to the version of the .NET Framework used for compiling your project. This is what actually matters when it comes to selecting the supported <span className="bold">TLS</span> version during the <span className="bold">TLS</span> handshake.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this article I will describe the changes I have made to our Azure hosting (where our ASP.NET WebAPIs are hosted) and the code changes which enabled <span className="bold">TLS 1.2</span> support.
              </p>
              <h2 className="step bold">Upgrading our Azure hosting to support TLS 1.2</h2>
              <p>
                More accurately the changes I have made to our Azure hosting have removed support for earlier versions of <span className="bold">TLS</span> i.e. <span className="bold">TLS 1.0/1.1</span>. Although this change was not strictly necessary to fix the problem I was experiencing, it was appropriate in terms of tightening up the security of our ASP.NET WebAPIs and to ensure that our own APIs can only be accessed by clients that support <span className="bold">TLS 1.2</span>. This is quite simply achieved by opening the Azure portal and navigating to the App Service hosting. From there the <span className="italics">TLS/SSL</span> Settings blade can be selected.
              </p>

              <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              I have set this to TLS 1.2 for both our staging and production environments. This sets the minimum TLS version. Therefore our hosting environments will no longer accept requests from earlier versions of TLS.

                Depending on what version of .NET Framework your project uses will dictate the possible solutions available to you. If your project compiles against .NET Framework &gt;= 4.7 then you are already good to go. Applications developed in .NET Framework 4.7 or greater automatically default to whatever the operating system they run on considers safe (which currently is TLS 1.2 and will later include TLS 1.3).
              </p>
              
              <p>
              If your application has been developed in a version of the .NET Framework prior to 4.7 then you have two options.
              </p>
              <p>
              Recompile your application using .NET Framework 4.7 or greater
              - If recompiling your application is not something you can do then you can update your .config file by adding the following.
              </p>
              <div className="greyBackground">

            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            For those of you who haven&#39;t read the old post, here is some background information. If you ever want to do your ASP.NET Core development using both WSL (using the Remote - WSL extension) and Windows, you will soon realize that there are some inherent issues with the local development certs… Mainly that ASP.NET Core sets up one development certificate in Windows, and one in Linux. And neither environment trusts the other. Not to mention that Linux doesn&#39;t even trust its own cert, making server to server communication hard in Linux.
            </p>
            <p>
            Unfortunately, the tools provided by dotnet doesn&#39;t quite seem to do the trick when trying to get mutual trust to work. I&#39;m not sure why, but at least on my machine, any cert that is generated by dotnet has problems when it comes to being able to trust it in Linux. So because of this, there are a few hoops we need to jump through to get this to work…
            </p>


            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            <strong> Note:</strong> My guess is that Linux requires a CA to issue the cert to be able to trust it. However, the cert generated by .NET is not a properly issued cert with a CA as this has some inherent dangers… Dangers I will ignore on my development box, and try to mitigate by keeping my cert VERY safe
            </p>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            In the previous post, there were quite a few steps involved in getting it to work. However, it can be simplified a bit at least…and made to work…
            </p>
           
            <h2 className="step bold">Dev certs in Linux</h2>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              When you install the .NET SDK, an ASP.NET developer certificate is generated and configured for use by ASP.NET. However, it doesn&#39;t seem like that cert is being properly trusted by Linux, causing server to server communication to fail. Because of this, we need to generate our own self-signed cert. Luckily, this isn&#39;t too hard with the help of Google…
            </p>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            The first step is to create an OpenSSL configuration file that looks like this
            </p>
           
            <p className="greyBackground">
              <OpenSSLConfgurationFile />
            </p>

            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            <strong> Note:</strong> This config creates a certificate that is both a CA and an SSL cert. The reason for this is that Linux needs a CA cert to be able to trust it.
            </p>

            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            Once we have our OpenSSL configuration, we can go ahead and generate our certificate by running

            </p>
            <p className="greyBackground">
              <GenerateCertificate />
            </p>
            
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            This generates a key pair based on the configuration file we just created.
            </p>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            Just for the sake of it, we can verify that it currently isn&#39;t trusted, by running
            </p>
            
            <p className="greyBackground">
              <VerifyCurrentlyNotTrustedCertificate />
            </p>
            

            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            To trust the cert, we need to copy it to /usr/local/share/ca-certificates, and add it to our trusted CA:s. Like this
            </p>
  
              <p>
              <AddToOurTrustedCertificate />
              </p>

              <p className="font-size: 28px;">
                After that, we should be able to verify that the cert is trusted by running openssl verify again
              </p>

            
              <p>
              <VerifyCertificateIsTrusted />
              </p>

              <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              The last step is to make sure that ASP.NET Core uses this certificate when SSL is turned on. This is easily done by running the dotnet dev-certs command. However, this command expects a PKCS12 certificate. So before we can do that, we need to convert our key pair into a PKCS12 cert using OpenSSL
              </p>
            
              <p>
              <PKCS12certificate />
              </p>

              <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              Once we have out PFX-file, we can finally tell ASP.NET to use it by running
              </p>

              

              <p className="font-size-16">
                  <strong>Remember:</strong> Make sure it is a secure password! If anyone should get their hands on this cert, it could be used to launch a malicious attack against your machine. So keeping it safe is VERY important! And also make sure that the key pair is stored in a safe place.
              </p>

                      <p className="font-size: 28px;">
                      Ok, that&#39;s it from the Linux side…
                     </p>

                     <h2 className="step bold">Dev certs in Windows</h2>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            When you install the .NET Core SDK on Windows, it creates a development HTTPS certificate for you automatically just like it does in Linux. All you have to do is run dotnet dev-certs https --trust to trust it and you are good to go! However, in this case we want to replace that cert with the cert we just created…
            </p>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            The first step in doing this, is to get hold of the PFX file we just generated. On my machine, I copy it to a user specific folder by running the following command in WSL
            </p>

            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            In a traditional .NET distributed application, application services (not to be confused with the Kubernetes &#39;service&#39; object) would either be written as IIS hosted web applications or Windows Services. When building .NET (micro)services to be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster pretty much every facet of the service needs to be reconsidered, not only the hosting environment but the way configuration is accessed, how logging and monitoring work, and the options for state management and memory considerations. In this post I&#39;ll bring my experience of migrating .NET applications to Kubernetes to enumerate some of the main ways that you&#39;ll need to change the way you write them.
            </p>
            <p>
            First some caveats. I don&#39;t intend this post to be an introduction to Kubernetes, or a justification of why you should use Kubernetes. Nor is it a tutorial on how to write distributed applications or .NET application services. It&#39;s intended audience is my past self about a year and a half ago. I would have very much appreciated a short guide on the changes I would have to make to redesign my .NET application services to take full advantage of Kubernetes.

                          <p className="font-size: 28px;">
                          One of the main advantages you&#39;ll find writing application services for Kubernetes is that the platform now provides many things that you would previously have had to include in your application. As I&#39;ll describe below things such as configuration, logging, metrics, and security all become simpler to implement.
                          </p>

                          <h2 className="step bold">Building your container images</h2>

                          <p className="font-size: 28px;">
                          Kubernetes is primarily a container orchestration framework. Your applications/services need to be built and deployed as (usually Docker) containers. Microsoft have published a very good guide to building and running containerized .NET applications,<a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/e-book/microservices-architecture/pdf" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}> NET Microservices Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications</a> that I&#39;recommend reading, although it doesn&#39;t cover Kubernetes the advice on creating container images and microservice architecture is very good.
                          </p>  

                          <p className="font-size: 28px;">
                          Although it&#39;s possible to compile your application in a traditional build server and then create the runtime container image from the compiled binaries, it&#39;s easier to combine the build and runtime in a single multi-stage docker file, that way you control the environment for both build and deployment. Here is a very simple example:
                          </p>



                <p>
                  <SingleMultiStageDockerKubernetes1 />
                </p>
              
                <p className="font-size: 28px;">
                As you can see there are multiple <span className="whiteBackground pinkTextOverlay">FROM</span> clauses. Each one discards the previous image so the  <span className="whiteBackground pinkTextOverlay">final</span> image is small.
            </p>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            Note, it&#39;s quite common to see just the .csproj file copied first for the restore phase, then the rest of the <span className="whiteBackground pinkTextOverlay">src</span> contents copied for the build. This will give you smaller, more efficient, layer cacheing. Although if you are using an ephemeral build server such as GitHub Actions, there&#39;s probably little to be gained. Personally I like to keep things simple.
            </p>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            Build the image with docker build:
            </p>
                <p>
                  <MikeHadlowWritingDotnetServicesForKubernetes1 />
                </p>

                <p className="font-size: 28px;">
                Once your container images are built, you should publish them to your internal image repository. GitHub provides a container registry as does Azure and all other cloud providers.
                </p>
              
                <h2 className="step bold">Deploying to Kubernetes</h2>

                <p className="font-size: 28px;">
                In the simplest case for an aspnet service you can deploy your application/service to Kubernetes by simply running a deployment specifying your image and the number of replicas you want:
                </p>

                <p>
                  <MikeHadlowWritingDotnetServicesForKubernetes2 />
                </p>

                <p className="font-size: 28px;">
                You will also need a Kubernetes “service” to direct traffic to your pods, something like:
                </p>
             
                <p>
                  <MikeHadlowWritingDotnetServicesForKubernetes3 />
                </p>
            <p>
            Use <span className="whiteBackground pinkTextOverlay">kubectl apply</span> to run the deployment: 
            </p>
            <p>
                  <MikeHadlowWritingDotnetServicesForKubernetes4 />
                </p>
            
            <p>
            Consider using Helm to template your deployments for any but the very simplest cases. I&#39;ve also had Kustomize recommended to me, which looks a little simpler than Helm, but I&#39;ve not used it myself. 
            </p>

            <h2 className="step bold">Build and Deployment</h2>
            <p>
              Your build and deploy pipeline will look something like this:
            </p>
                        <p>
                            <ol>
                            <li>
                              <span className="article-post-sub"> 1.  </span><span className="whiteBackground pinkTextOverlay">docker build .</span> Build your service container image.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <span className="article-post-sub">2.  </span><span className="whiteBackground pinkTextOverlay">docker push ...</span> Push your image to your image repository.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <span className="article-post-sub">3.  </span><span className="whiteBackground pinkTextOverlay">kubectl apply ...</span> Execute the YAML file defining your deployment against your Kubernetes cluster.
                            </li>
                            </ol>
                          </p>


            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            If you are using GitHub for source control GitHub actions are a good choice for running these steps on a successful commit or pull request merge.

            <p dir="auto">This document outlines recommendations for cryptographic algorithm choices and parameters as well as important implementation details based on what I have learnt from reading about the subject and the consensus I have observed online. Note that <em>some</em> knowledge of cryptography is required to understand the terminology used in these guidelines.</p>
            
            <p dir="auto">My goal with these guidelines is to provide a resource that I wish I had access to when I first started writing programs related to cryptography. If this information helps prevent even just one vulnerability, then I consider it time well spent.</p>

              <h3 className="f5 text-normal">Disclaimer</h3>
             

            <p dir="auto">I am a psychology undergraduate with an interest in applied cryptography, not an experienced cryptographer. I primarily have experience with the <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/" rel="nofollow" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>libsodium</a> library since that&#39;s what I&#39;ve used for my projects, but I&#39;ve also reported some security vulnerabilities related to cryptography.</p>
           
            <p dir="auto">Most experienced cryptographers don&#39;t have the time to write things like this, and the following information is freely available online or in books, so whilst more experience would be beneficial, I&#39;m trying my best to provide accurate information that can be fact checked. <strong>If I&#39;ve made a mistake, please contact me to get it fixed</strong>.</p>
              <p dir="auto">Note that the rankings are based on my opinion, algorithm availability in cryptographic libraries, and which algorithms are typically used in modern protocols, such as <a href="https://www.davidwong.fr/tls13/" rel="nofollow" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>TLS 1.3</a>, <a href="https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html" rel="nofollow" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Noise Protocol Framework</a>, <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/protocol/" rel="nofollow" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>WireGuard</a>, and so on. Such protocols and recommended practices make for the best guidelines because they have been approved by experienced professionals.</p>

           
            <h3 className="f5 text-normal">General Guidelines</h3>
            <ol dir="auto">
                <li>
                <p dir="auto">Research, research, research: you often don&#39;t need to know how cryptographic algorithms work under the hood to implement them correctly, just like how you don&#39;t need to know how a car works to drive. However, you need to know enough about what you&#39;re trying to do, which requires looking up relevant information online or in books, reading the documentation for the cryptographic library you&#39;re using, reading RFC standards, reading helpful blog posts, and reading guidelines like this one. Furthermore, reading books about the subject in general will be beneficial, again like how knowing about cars can help if you break down. For a list of great resources, check out my <a href="https://samuellucas.com/blog/how-to-learn-about-cryptography.html" rel="nofollow" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>How to Learn About Cryptography</a> blog post.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p dir="auto">Check and check again: it&#39;s your responsibility to get things right the first time around to the best of your ability rather than relying on peer review. Therefore, I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend always reading over security sensitive code at least twice and testing it to ensure that it&#39;s operating as expected (e.g. checking the value of variables line by line using a debugger, using test vectors, etc).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p dir="auto">Peer review is great but often doesn&#39;t happen: unless your project is popular, you have a bug bounty program with cash rewards, or what you&#39;re developing is for an organisation, very few people, perhaps none, will look through the code to find and report vulnerabilities. Similarly, receiving funding for a code audit will probably be impossible.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p dir="auto"><strong>Please don&#39;t create your own custom cryptographic algorithms (e.g. a custom cipher or hash function)</strong>: this is like flying a Boeing 747 without a pilot license but worse because even experienced cryptographers design <a href="https://competitions.cr.yp.to/sha3.html" rel="nofollow" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>insecure</a> algorithms, which is why cryptographic algorithms are thoroughly analysed by a large number of cryptanalysts, usually as part of a <a href="https://competitions.cr.yp.to/index.html" rel="nofollow" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>competition</a>. By contrast, you rarely see experienced airline pilots crashing planes. The only <em>exception</em> to this rule is implementing something like Encrypt-then-MAC with secure, <strong>existing</strong> cryptographic algorithms <strong>when you know what you&#39;re doing</strong>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p dir="auto"><strong>Please avoid coding existing cryptographic algorithms yourself (e.g. coding AES yourself)</strong>: cryptographic libraries provide access to these algorithms for you to prevent people from making mistakes that cause vulnerabilities and to offer good performance. Whilst a select few algorithms are relatively simple to implement, like <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5869" rel="nofollow" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>HKDF</a>, <a href="https://loup-vaillant.fr/articles/implementing-elligator" rel="nofollow" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>many aren&#39;t</a> and require a great deal of experience to implement correctly. Lastly, another reason to avoid doing this is that it&#39;s not much fun since academic papers and reference implementations can be very difficult to understand.</p>

Furthermore, the APIs are typically easy to misuse, the documentation may fail to mention important security related information, and the implementations will be slower than libsodium. However, certain languages, such as <a href="https://golang.org/" rel="nofollow" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Go</a> and <a href="https://ziglang.org/" rel="nofollow" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Zig</a> have impressive modern cryptography support.</p>

For instance, CryptoJS uses an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/evp_bytestokey" rel="nofollow" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>insecure</a> KDF called <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/EVP_BytesToKey.html" rel="nofollow" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>EVP_BytesToKey()</a> in OpenSSL when you pass a string password to <a href="https://cryptojs.gitbook.io/docs/#ciphers" rel="nofollow" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>AES.encrypt()</a>, and BouncyCastle has no C# documentation. However, this recommendation is too broad really since there are <em>some</em> libraries that I haven&#39;t mentioned that are worth using, like <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/paseto" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>PASETO</a>. Therefore, as a rule of thumb, <strong>if it doesn&#39;t include several of the algorithms I recommend in this document, then it&#39;s probably bad</strong>.

                <li>
                <p dir="auto">If the library you&#39;re currently using/planning to use doesn&#39;t support several of the algorithms I&#39;m recommending, then it&#39;s time to upgrade and take advantage of the improved security and performance benefits available to you if you switch.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p dir="auto">Please read the documentation: don&#39;t immediately jump into coding something because that&#39;s how mistakes are made. Good libraries have high quality documentation that will explain potential security pitfalls and how to avoid them.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p dir="auto">Some libraries release unauthenticated plaintext when using AEADs: for example, OpenSSL and BouncyCastle <a href="https://github.com/SalusaSecondus/CryptoGotchas">apparently do</a>. Firstly, don&#39;t use these libraries for this reason and the reasons I&#39;ve already listed. Secondly, <strong>never do anything with unauthenticated plaintext; ignore it to be safe</strong>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p dir="auto">Older doesn&#39;t mean better: you can argue that older algorithms are more battle tested and therefore proven to be a safe choice, but the reality is that most modern algorithms, like ChaCha20, BLAKE2, and Argon2, have been properly analysed at this point and shown to offer security and performance benefits over their older counterparts. Therefore, it doesn&#39;t make sense to stick to this overly cautious mindset of avoiding newer algorithms, except for algorithms that are still candidates in a <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography" rel="nofollow">competition</a> (e.g. new post-quantum algorithms), which do need further analysis to be considered safe.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p dir="auto">You should prioritise speed: this can make a noticeable difference for the user. For example, a C# Argon2 library is going to be significantly slower than Argon2 in libsodium, meaning unnecessary and unwanted extra delay during key derivation. Libsodium is the go-to for speed on desktops/servers, and Monocypher is the go-to for constrained environments (e.g. microcontrollers).</p>

              While reading  <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/real-world-cryptography" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Real-World Cryptography 
              </a>, I came across the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_chosen-ciphertext_attack" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>&#34;million message attack&#34;. 
              </a> This is an attack that Daniel Bleichenbacher demonstrated in 1998, which effectively broke RSA with a particular encoding function called PKCS #1. It was only mentioned briefly, so I dug in and decided to try to understand the attack, eventually to implement it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most crypto libraries do not ship with a vulnerable implementation of this, for good reason. It&#39;s been broken! And if I implement the full attack against a real implementation, it would also come with using realistic key size.
            </p>
       
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              Instead, I decided to implement RSA myself so that I could implement a weak encoding scheme so I could implement the Bleichenbacher attack! So far, I have an implementation of RSA and of PKCS (the vulnerable one). The basics of RSA took an hour to implement, then what felt like days to debug. And now it (seemingly) works! The attack will follow soon, with any luck.

            <h2 className="step bold">What&#39;s RSA, anyway?</h2>

            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              RSA is a public-key cryptosystem, in contrast to symmetric key cryptosystems. With symmetric keys, the sender and the recipient both share a key and use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the message. In contrast, public-key cryptosystems have a key pair, a public and a private key. The public key can be used to encrypt messages and the private key to decrypt them<sup>1</sup>.
            </p>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              One of the drawbacks of a symmetric key system is that you have to share the key. This means you have to use a different secure channel to transmit the key, and then both parties need to be really careful to keep it a secret. This isn&#39;t manageable for a system with a lot of participants, like the internet!
            </p>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            But symmetric key encryption is often very fast, and we have some of the operations for it even  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>baked into hardware.</a> It would be nice to use it where we can for that efficiency.
            </p>


            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              In contrast, with public-key cryptography, you can freely share the public key, and anyone can then use that to encrypt a message to you. This means you do not need a separate secure channel to share the key! (Although this ignores the whole problem of validating that the key comes from the right person, so you&#39;re not having your connection spoofed by an interloper.) And this is great! This is what RSA gives us, but the computations for RSA are slow and the messages you can send are also small.
            </p>

            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              In practice, RSA was used (regrettably, sometimes still is) to establish a secure connection and perform a key exchange, and then the keys you exchange let you use symmetric key encryption. You probably 
              <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/08/fuck-rsa/" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}> shouldn&#39;t use RSA.</a> Modern alternatives exist that are better, like Curve25519 and other forms of elliptic-curve cryptography.
            </p>

            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              But for worse, we run into RSA, and it&#39;s also a fun historical artifact! It&#39;s worth understanding in, and hey, implementing it is just plain fun.
            </p>

            <h2 className="step bold">The basics of RSA</h2>

              <p>
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>RSA </a>is a nicely elegant cryptosystem. Its security is based on the difficulty of factoring the product of large prime numbers, and in its purest form it has no known breaks<sup>2</sup>.However, as mentioned above, depending on how data is encoded, particular uses of it can be broken.
              </p>

              <p className="font-size: 28px;">
                The basic operations of it are straightforward to express. There are three components:
              </p>                       
              <p>

                <ol>
                    <p>
                      <li>
                    <span className="article-post">1.  </span> Generating keys

                    </li>

                    <span className="article-post">2.  </span> Encrypting and decrypting!
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <span className="article-post">3.  </span>  Encoding messages
                    </li>
                    </p>
                </ol>           
              </p>

              <p className="font-size: 28px;">
                We&#39;ll go through each of those, starting with generating keys.
              </p>  

              <h2 className="step bold">Generating your keys</h2>
              <p className="font-size: 28px;">
                First of all, what even is a key? We know that it&#39;s used to encrypt or decrypt a message, but what is inside it?
              </p>  
              <p>
                For RSA, a key comprises two numbers. One of these is called the <span className="bold">exponent</span> and one is the <span className="bold">modulus</span>. A key could be <span className="bold">(exp=3, mod=3233)</span>, for example. It&#39;s really just this pair of numbers<sup>3</sup>.
              </p>

              <p className="font-size: 28px;">
                The reason the pieces of it are called the exponent and modulus is because of how we use them! RSA relies on 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>modular arithmetic </a>
                 (like clock math, if you&#39;re not familiar). These are the exponents and modulus for the encryption or decryption operations which we&#39;ll see later.
              </p>  
            
              <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              To generate a key, you follow a short procedure.
              </p>  

              <p>

                <ol>
                    <p>
                      <li>
                    <span className="article-post">1.  </span> First, pick two prime numbers which we&#39;ll call p and q. Then we compute <span className="bold">n = p * q.</span>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <span className="article-post">2.  </span> Compute a number <span className="bold">t = lcm(p-1, q-1).</span> This is the totient, and we use this as our modulus for generating the keys but then never again.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <span className="article-post">3.  </span>  Pick the public exponent, which we&#39;ll call <span className="bold">e.</span> The requirement is that it shares no factors with t and is greater than 2. One simple way is to start with 3, but go up through the primes until you find one coprime with t. Choosing 65537 is also quite common, since it&#39;s small enough to be efficient for encryption but large enough to avoid some particular attacks.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <span className="article-post">4.  </span>  Calculate the private exponent, which we&#39;ll call <span className="bold">d.</span> We compute this as <span className="bold">d = e^-1 mod t,</span> or the inverse of <span className="bold">e</span> in our modulus.
                    </li>

                    </p>
                </ol>           
              </p>


              <p className="font-size: 28px;">
                Now you have<span className="bold">d</span> and <span className="bold">e</span>, the private and public exponents, and you have n, the modulus. Bundle those up into two tuples and you have your keys!
              </p> 



              <p className="font-size: 28px;">
                Let&#39;s work an example quickly to see how it ends up. For our primes, we can choose <span className="bold">p = 17 </span>and <span className="bold">q = 29</span>. So then <span className="bold">n = 493</span>.
              </p>

              <p className="font-size: 28px;">
                Now we find <span className="bold">t = lcm(17 - 1, 29 - 1) = lcm(16, 28) = 112 </span>. We&#39;ll choose e = 3, which works since 2 &lt; 3 and gcd(3, 112) = 1 so we know they share no factors. Now we compute <sub>4</sub> <span className="bold">d = e<sup>-1</sup> = 3<sup>-1</sup> = 75 mod 112.</span>   And then we have our keys!
              </p>


              <p className="font-size: 28px;">
                Our public key is (exp=3, mod=493), and our private key is (exp=75, mod=493). We&#39;ll use these again in our examples on encrypting and decrypting!
              </p>

            </p>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              This note documents one of my recent adventures in performance optimization with Rust. By following along, hopefully you&#39;ll learn something about how to write fast Rust.
            </p>
            <p>
            Here&#39;s the context: imagine you have data from an online exam where a set of users answered a set of questions. The raw data looks like this:
            </p>
              

            <p className="greyBackground">
              <AnalyzeData180000xFasterRust />
            </p>

            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              Note that each user only answered a subset of all possible questions, and all scores are either 0 or 1.
            </p>
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
            Here&#39;s the problem: given a size  <span className="italics">k</span>, which set of <span className="italics">k</span> questions has the highest correlation with overall performance? We&#39;ll call this the <span className="bold">k-CorrSet problem</span>. A simple brute-force algorithm for solving the k-CorrSet problem looks like this pseudocode:
            </p>
            
            <p className="font-size: 28px;">
              We are going to implement several variations on this algorithm to see how fast we can make it.
            </p>
  
                      <p><strong>Can you explain in depth on this?</strong></p>
          <p>The algorithm iterates through all possible k-sized subsets of questions, calculates the correlation between the scores on that subset and the grand scores on all questions, and returns the subset with the maximum correlation.</p>

          <p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Certainly! Let&#39;s break down the key steps of the algorithm that iterates through all possible k-sized subsets of questions, calculates the correlation, and returns the subset with the maximum correlation.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Here&#39;s a more detailed explanation:</strong></p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><span className="article-post">1.  </span> <strong>Generate all k-sized subsets of questions:</strong></p>
              <p>The algorithm starts by obtaining all possible questions from the given dataset. Then, it iterates through all k-sized subsets of these questions. For example, if k is 3, it would consider all possible combinations of 3 questions out of the total set of questions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><span className="article-post">2.  </span><strong>Identify users who answered every question in the subset:</strong></p>
              <p>For each k-sized subset of questions, the algorithm identifies all users who answered every question in that subset. This is important because the correlation calculation requires data from users who answered all questions in the subset.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><span className="article-post">3.  </span><strong>Calculate total scores on the subset for each user:</strong></p>
              <p>Once the algorithm has the subset of questions and the corresponding users, it calculates the total score on that subset for each user. It sums up the scores of each user for the questions in the subset.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><span className="article-post">4.  </span><strong>Calculate the grand total scores on all questions for each user:</strong></p>
              <p>Simultaneously, the algorithm calculates the grand total scores on all questions for each user. This involves summing up the scores of each user for all questions, not just the subset.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><span className="article-post">5.  </span><strong>Calculate the correlation between subset scores and grand total scores:</strong></p>
              <p>With the total scores on the subset and the grand total scores for each user, the algorithm calculates the correlation between these two sets of scores. The correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two sets of data. It ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation.</p>
              <p>The correlation calculation could use statistical methods such as Pearson correlation coefficient, which measures the linear correlation between two variables. The formula for Pearson correlation is:</p>
              <p>𝑟 = ∑ (𝑥𝑖 − 𝑥¯)(𝑦𝑖 − 𝑦¯ ) / √ ∑ (𝑥𝑖 − 𝑥¯ )^2 ∑ (𝑦 − 𝑦¯ )^2</p>
              <p>Where:</p>
              <p>𝑥𝑖xi and 𝑦𝑖yi are the individual scores of the users on the subset and grand total, respectively.</p>
              <p>𝑥¯xˉ and 𝑦¯yˉ are the means of the scores on the subset and grand total, respectively.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><span className="article-post">6.  </span><strong>Return the subset with the maximum correlation:</strong></p>
              <p>After calculating the correlation for each k-sized subset, the algorithm identifies the subset with the maximum correlation coefficient and returns it as the result. This subset is considered to have the highest correlation with overall performance.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
          <p>The described algorithm is a brute-force approach, meaning it considers all possible subsets and calculates correlations for each. While it provides a straightforward solution to the k-CorrSet problem, it might be computationally expensive for large datasets. The author&#39;s exploration in Rust likely involves optimizing this algorithm or exploring alternative approaches to improve its efficiency.</p>

            The tremendous influx of traffic to Mastodon got me thinking that it might finally be time to set up my own instance, and how-to posts from <a href="https://jacobian.org/til/my-mastodon-instance/" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Jacob</a> and <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/mastodon/custom-domain-mastodon" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Simon</a> have only increased that interest. But as a little branding excercise, and <em>especially</em> if I want to offer accounts to a few close friends, surely I could do something a little more fun than just my first and last name.

            <a href="https://instances.social/" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>Many Mastodon instances</a> are on subdomains, and since the early days weirder new-style TLDs have been de rigueur. (The flagship has always been at a <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.social</code>!) So I set out to find three-word phrases where the third word is a 4+-letter top-level domain, using as my first source text Moby Dick.

              The results were great! The script I wrote output all possible options, which I then spot-checked to see which were available, but I’ve since updated the script to do a quick <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">whois</code> check to see if the domain is already registered. (<code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">whois</code> support is a little spotty for some of the weirder domains, so many are inconclusive, but I was surprised at some of the good ones available.) As of right now, here are some possible instances available for registration:

            <a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/Napa-FFT3" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}> Napa-FFT3 </a>is in the latest Quicklisp release. Unlike previous attempts that were really proofs of concept, this one feels solid enough for actual use.
            </p>
            <p>
            This third version is extremely different from the first two: rather than trying to compute in-order FFTs without blowing caches, it generates code for bit-reversed FFTs. The idea came from Brad Lucier, who sent me a couple emails and showed how nicely his FFT scaled (it&#39;s used in gambit&#39;s bignum code). Bit-reversed FFTs don&#39;t have to go through any special contortion to enjoy nice access patterns: everything is naturally sequential. The downside is that the output is in the wrong order (in bit-reversed order). However, it might still be an overall win over directly computing DFTs in order: we only need to execute one bit-reversal pass, and we can also provide FFT routines that work directly on bit-reversed inputs.
            </p>
            <p>
            My hope when I started writing Napa-FFT3 was that I could get away with a single generator that&#39;d work well at all sizes, and that bit-reversing would either not be too much of an issue, or usually not needed (e.g., for people who only want to perform convolutions or filtering).
            </p>
            <h2 className="step bold">Overview of the code</h2>
            <p>
            The forward and inverse transform generators are pretty simple implementations of the split-radix FFT.
            </p>
            <p>
            Generator for “flat” base cases output code for a specialised compiler geared toward large basic blocks. The specialised compiler takes potentially very long traces of simple operations on array elements, and performs two optimisations: array elements are cached in variables (registers), and variables are explicitly spilled back into arrays, following Belady&#39;s algorithm. That allows us to easily exploit the register file, without taking its size directly into account in the domain-specific generators, and even when we have to cope with a relatively naïve machine code generator like SBCL&#39;s.
            </p>
            <p>
            Larger input sizes instead use a generator that outputs almost-normal recursive code; theret&#39;s one routine for each input size, which helps move as much address computation as possible to compile-time.
            </p>
            <p>
            Even with code to handle scaling and convolution/filtering, I feel that the generators are easily understood and modified. They currently only support in-order input for the forward transform, and in-order output for the inverse, but the generators are simple enough that adding code for all four combinations (in-order input or output, forward or inverse transform) would be reasonable! I believe thatt&#39;s a win.
            </p>
            <p>
            Better: it seems my hope that we can execute bit reverses quickly was more than justified. It&#39;m not quite sure how to describe it, but the code is based on recursing on the indices from the middle bits toward the least and most significant bits. The result is that the theret&#39;s exactly one swap at each leaf of the recursion, and that, when cache associativity is high enough (as is the case for the x86 chips I use), all the cache misses are mandatory. Better, the recursiveness ensures that the access patterns are also TLB optimal, when the TLB associativity is high enough (or infinite, as for my x86oids).
            </p>
            <p>
            Theret&#39;s one issue with that recursive scheme: itt&#39;s really heavy in integer arithmetic to compute indices. Again, I generate large basic blocks to work around that issue. The last couple levels (three, by default) of the recursion are unrolled and compiled into a long sequence of swaps. The rest of the recursion is executed by looping over a vector that contains indices that were computed at compile-time.
            </p>

            <h2 className="step bold">Correctness</h2>

            <p>
            I have a hard time convincing myself that code generators are correct, especially without a nice static type system. Instead, I heavily tested the final generated code. I&#39;m using Common Lisp, so array accesses were all checked automatically, which was very useful early in the development processes. Once I was convinced certain that all accesses were correct, I turned bound and type checking off. The first test file implements a set of randomised tests proposed by Funda Ergün. That was enough for me to assume that the FFTs themselves were correct. I then turned to a second set of tests to try and catch issues in the rest of the code that builds on straight FFT
            </p>
            <p>
            The process did catch a couple bugs, and makes me feel confident enough to let other people use Napa-FFT3 in their programs.
            </p>


            <h2 className="step bold">Performance</h2>

            <p>
            Napa-FFT and Napa-FFT2 managed to come reasonably close to FFTW&#39;s performance. When I started working on Napa-FFT3, I hoped that it could come as close, with much less complexity. In fact, it performs even better than expected: Napa-FFT3 is faster than Napa-FFT(2) at nearly all sizes, and outperforms FFTW&#39;s default planner for out-of-cache transforms (even with the bit-reversal pass).
            </p>

            <h2 className="step bold">Napa-FFT3: Overview</h2>
            <p>
            Napa-FFT3 is a complete rewrite of Napa-FFT (version 2 is an aborted experiment). The goal is still the same: to provide, via a mixture of cache-friendly algorithms and code generation, FFT routines in Common Lisp that offer performance comparable to the state of the art. In that regard, it is a success: depending on how it&#39;s used, Napa-FFT3 is, at most, around three times as slow as FFTW on small or medium inputs, and can be faster than FFTW for large inputs. The complete picture is more complicated than this; see the Performance section for details.
            </p>

            <p>
            The goal of Napa-FFT3 isn&#39;t only to provide Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) routines, but also (rather) to provide buildings blocks to express common operations that involve DFTs: filtering, convolutions, etc. This is what enables Napa-FFT to achieve such high performance without optimizing at the assembly level. The Easy Interface section should suffice for most developers; the Low-level Interface is described in another section, and may be of interest to some.
            </p>

            <p>
            Napa-FFT3 also expressly supports FFTs on real data and inverse FFTs back to real data. The Real Interface section describes the facility, and is used in conjunction with the Easy Interface.
            </p>

            <p>
            Finally, see the Installation section for installation instructions, and the Implementation section for all the gory details.
            </p>

            <p>
            Note that Napa-FFT3 currently only supports power-of-two-sized inputs; even when/if it will gain code for arbitrary sizes, powers of two will most likely be much more efficient, both in terms of runtime and space usage.
            </p>

                          <p>
                          FFT computes the DFT of the first size values in vec.
            </p>

            <p>
            First, vec is converted to a simple array of complex samples if necessary. The result is stored in dst, or a fresh array of complex doubles. dst may be the same object as vec for an in-place transform.
            </p>

            <p>
            If window is non-nil, each value in vec is multiplied by the corresponding value in window during the transform; similarly, the values are scaled according to the value of scale.
            </p>

            <p>
            If in-order is true, the result is then converted to be in order, which can take more than half as much time as the FFT itself.
            </p>

                <i className="bi bi-calendar-date flex">12/03/2023</i>
                <p>Let&#39;s say we have vectors <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A1..An</code>. We know their dot products to <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u</code> and <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v</code>, but not <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u</code> and <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v</code> themselves. Can we estimate <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u.v</code> (ie their cosine similarity)?</p>
            </p>

            <span className="bold">Extra: </span>

            <p>This could be handy in vector similarity systems. With just a few strategically selected reference points <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A1..An</code> we might get an accurate view of <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u.v</code> without storing the full vector. Or at least that&#39;s the hope!</p>


            <p>We first asked this question with <a href="blog/2023/03/02/shared-dot-product.html">just one reference point</a>. Then <a href="/blog/2023/03/10/two-shared-reference-points">we upgraded to two</a>. Next we <em>reach out with our feelings</em> to get to all <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">An</code> reference points.</p>

            <h2 id="recap---using-two-reference-points">Recap - using two reference points</h2>
           
            <p>With just one reference point, we can estimate <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u.v</code> with just <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u.A1 * v.A1</code>. Easy enough.</p>
           
            <p>To add a second, <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A2</code>, we figure out how much of <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u.A2*v.A2</code> to include in <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u.v</code>. We see how much of <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A2</code> is already included in the original reference point <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A1</code>. The leftover parts parts, we add to <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u.v</code>.</p>

            <p>

            </p>


              <p>Applying the trig knowledge you told your teacher you&#39;d never need, you know that &#39;leftover&#39; here is really &#39;sin&#39;. So we get:</p>

              <div className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div className="highlight"><pre className="highlight"><code>u.v = u.A1*v.A1 + sin(θ1)*u.A2*v.A2
              </code></pre></div></div>


              <p>Or put another way. if <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A1</code> and <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A2</code> are parallel, there&#39;s no point in looking at the dot product <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u.A2</code> - it’s just <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u.A1</code> again. But as A2 rotates away, we add more and more of <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u.A2</code> in.</p>
             
              <h2 id="up-to-3-or-n-reference-points">Up to 3 (or n) reference points</h2>
            
              <p>Going up to 3 (or n) dimensions, we need a similar procedure. However we need the leftovers of <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A3</code> outside the <em>plane</em> created by <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A1</code> and <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A2</code>. That little slice of heaven shown below:</p>

              <p><img src="https://softwaredoug.com/assets/media/2023/slice_of_heaven.png" alt="image.png"></img></p>

              <p>The mathy way of defining the “plane” where <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A1</code> and <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A2</code> lie (really any <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A1...An-1</code>) is called a <a href="https://www.statlect.com/matrix-algebra/linear-span">span</a>.</p>

              <p>The problem becomes, how do we find an angle, <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">θ</code>, between <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">An</code> - not on the span - and its closest point on the span <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A1...An-1</code>.</p>

              <p><img src="https://softwaredoug.com/assets/media/2023/theta_onto_heaven.png" alt="image.png theta"></img></p>

              <p>If we find <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">θ</code> we can add another <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+ sin(θ)*u.An*v.An</code> to the dot product and improve our estimate.</p>
              <p>The &#39;closest point&#39; of <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">An</code> on the span is known as a vector&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(linear_algebra)">orthogonal projection</a>, shown below:</p>
            

              <p>If we could find the projection, a little trig can get us <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">θ</code> - the angle between <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">An</code> and its <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">projection</code> - and thus <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sin(θ)</code> - and viola leftovers 🍰!</p>

              <p>How do we find the projection? Luckily there&#39;s an existing algorithm. However, it requires an important input: the vectors describing the <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A1..An-1</code> “slice of heaven” span must be made orthogonal to each other.</p>

            <h2>Examples</h2>

            <p>Enough talk about the general aspects of <code>DSPLib</code>. The examples below will show how easy it is to apply in practice.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>There is a real need for a ready to use Fourier Transform Library that users can take right out of the box and perform Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) or Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT) and get a classical spectrum versus frequency plot.</p>
            
            <p>The vast majority of code that you will find in Commercial packages, Open Source libraries, Textbooks and on the Web are simply unsuited for this task and takes hours of further tweaking to get a classic and properly scaled spectrum plot.</p>
            
            <p>The library presented here is a practical, organized and complete .NET 4+ Open Source library of DSP oriented routines released under the very non-restrictive MIT License.</p>

            <h2>What DSPLib Does</h2>
            <p>DSPLib has several main parts, but its basic goal is to allow a real Fourier Transform to be preformed on a time series input array, resulting in a usable classic spectrum output without any further tweaking required by the user.</p>
           
            <p>Basic Fourier Transforms (FT) come in two basic types: the most general form can produce a spectrum output from any length of input data. This type of transform is called the Discrete Fourier Transform or DFT. The code is simple and brute force.</p>

            <ul>
	<li>The pros are: The input data can be any length.</li>	<li>The cons are: Since it is a general method, it is computationally intensive and large input data sets can take a very long time to calculate.</li></ul>

  <p>A more specific type of FT is called the Fast Fourier Transform or FFT.</p>

  <ul>
	<li>The pros are: It is much, much faster to compute than the DFT.</li>	<li>The cons are: The input data length is constrained to be power of twos. The code is more complex to understand.</li></ul>

  <p>As an example: A 8192 point FFT takes: less than 1 Millisecond on my i7 Computer. A DFT of the same length takes 360 Milliseconds. Hence you can see why the FFT is much more popular than the brute force DFT in real time applications.</p>

  <p>DSPLib implements both kinds of Fourier Transform.</p>

  <div><em><strong>Note</strong>: For the remainder of this article, the generalized Fourier Transform will be referred to as a &#39;FT&#39; when the discussion can apply to either a &#39;FFT&#39; or &#39;DFT&#39; as they both produce the same result for equivalent input data.</em></div>

  <p>All FTs can take a real or complex number input and naturally produce a complex number result. All FTs produced to date have implemented their own Complex Number type and this naturally leads to incompatibilities between libraries. .NET 4.0 finally includes (in the <code>System.Numerics</code> namespace) a Complex number structure and many math methods for operating on complex numbers. <code>DSPLib</code> incorporates the .NET 4 Complex Number Type.</p>

  <p>To have real speed improvements and to automatically scale the speed on processors with multiple cores and/or threads, <code>DSPLib</code> also implements the Task Parallel Extensions built into .NET 4. This leads to a real improvement in execution time that automatically scales with the number of processor cores / threads available. For instance, on a 2 core / 4 thread i7 processor, using the Task Parallel extensions decreases the execution time of a 10,000 point DFT by more than 3X.</p>

  <p>Smart caching of Sine and Cosine multiplication terms on smaller DFTs also increases performance by around 3X.</p>

  <p>Both of these easy to implement features increase the raw DFT Speed by around 9 times even on a low end i7 processor.</p>
  <h3>Real and Imaginary Spectrum Parts</h3>
  <p>All FT implementations naturally produce an output data array that is the same length as the input array. The output however consists not only of complex numbers, but Real and Imaginary parts of the Spectrum itself – sometimes called negative frequencies depending on how one wants to think about it. The Imaginary part of the spectrum is just the mirror image of the Real part and does not contain any additional information about the spectrum.</p>
  <h3>Zero Padding and Scaling</h3>
  <p>Zero padding is a very useful trick that is used with FFTs and DFTs. One use is to round the length of input data up to the next power of two so that a faster FFT can be used for the transform method. For instance, if you had 1000 points of input data, you can zero pad an additional 24 points onto the data so that a 1024 point FFT can be preformed instead of a slower 1000 point DFT (nearly a 9X speed improvement on my computer).</p>
   
  <p>Another use for zero padding is to make the display look more like an expected spectrum display. Zero padding broadens any peak(s) by interpolating points on the display and this makes a plot look better on a display screen or a plot. Zero padding also interpolates the space between calculated points reducing amplitude error when signals are not directly at the bin centers of the FT.</p>

  <p>Finally, zero padding allows a very fine look at the sidelobes and sideband suppression added by the window.</p>
  <p>Zero padding has an influence on the resulting spectrum output amplitudes even when the signals are at the bin centers. The FT routines presented here take an initialization parameter that includes the desired zero padding number so that the proper re-scaling factors can automatically be taken into account. Since the FT routines know about the desired zero padding for scaling reasons, they add the requested amount of zeros to the input data so the user does not have to.</p>

  <p>Reference [2] has more information on Zero Padding and even more uses for it.</p>
